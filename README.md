# 2015_Graphics_project
This code is for Lesson 2015_Graphics @Fudan.
The target is to create a cube and show its projection. The progamme should not use any third library but drawpixel function provided by Java.
Coach Han wrote Drawline function and Fillpolygon function.
I wrote the cube and rotate it.
